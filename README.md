### Today, organizing a trip takes a lot of time and is often a source of conflict, often between people. The aim is to maximize the urban tourist experience and to reduce the preparation time for a stay as much as possible. We will propose a personalized itinerary according to the profiles of the users in order to organize their days. The challenge of this application is therefore to save time for users and to discover less highlighted places.

### This project will be the mobile application for the IOS operating system which will allow users to generate personalized itineraries to visit a city by integrating a description of the monuments/places that one wishes to see.
